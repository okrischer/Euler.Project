This website contains my solutions in `Julia` to the first 99 problems of
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), including some annotations and explanations.

Please notice that, according to the policy of *Project Euler*, there will be no
solutions to problems with $n >= 100$.

Also notice that none of my solutions actually contains the searched value in order
to prevent you from cheating yourself.
